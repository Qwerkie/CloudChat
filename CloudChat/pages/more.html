      Academic Integrity:  
      Penn State Erie puts a very high value on academic integrity, and violations are not tolerated.  Academic integrity is one of Penn State&#39;s four principles to which all students must abide.  Any violation of academic integrity will receive academic and possible disciplinary sanctions, including the possible awarding of an XF grade which is recorded on the transcript and states that failure of the course was due to an act of academic dishonesty.  All acts of academic dishonesty are recorded so repeat offenders can be sanctioned accordingly. Students are encouraged to review more information on academic integrity which can be found at: <a href="http://www.pserie.psu.edu/faculty/academics/integrity.htm"> http://www.pserie.psu.edu/faculty/academics/integrity.htm </a>
