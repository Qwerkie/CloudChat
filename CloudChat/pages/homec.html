        <h2 class="heading">Objective</h2>
        <p>
        The goal of the course is to introduce students to the most significant and exciting computing paradigm--net-centric computing and service-oriented computing, which is expected to have an impact on all aspects of software construction at least as wide as that of object-oriented paradigm. This is a wide area and it is ever-evolving. We focus on the following aspects
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">On the client</h2>
        <p>
            We will learn Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript and AJAX to develop the client side of Rich Web Applications. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">client-server-communication</h2>
        <p>
            We will learn how to create and validate XML documents and use these as the primary language for transmission of data from the server to the client. We will also consider how JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) can sometimes be used as a viable alternative to XML for server to client data transmission.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">On the server</h2>
        <p>
            We will learn about a variety of server-side technologies, including XML binding tools, JSP, and security. We especially focus on web services and learn how servers (or non-browser clients) may consume RESTful or SOAP-based web services.
