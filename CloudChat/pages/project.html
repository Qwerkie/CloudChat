    <h2>Labs</h2>
    <p>
      The hands-on laboratory component concentrates mainly on the use of Java techniques to develop Web applications. The purpose of the lab assignments is to reinforce your understanding of the material taught in class, and encourage you to do research to broaden your knowledge on corresponding topics. <mark style="background-color=yellow">The labs are group assignments</mark>. Each group should <span style="color:red;">work as a team effectively</span> to finish the assignments. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Labs are assigned on a weekly basis. Typically, the assignment for Friday&#39;s lab will be posted to Angel <b>on Thursday</b>. Lab reports are due by <b style="color:red;">midnight (11:59pm) Wednesday</b> of the following week. Each team should have a person responsible for submitting your lab reports to the designated drop-box on Angel. Your submission should be in one zip file, following the pattern <b style="color:red;">CSSE-WEB-Lab-X-Team-Y.zip</b> to name the file, where X is the lab number (from 1 to 13), and Y is the team number assigned. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lab solutions will be posted to Angel on <b>Thursday</b>. Labs that are turned in late (after <b>midnight Wednesday</b>) will be assessed with a penalty of 20%. However, if the lab assignment is turned in after the solution is posted, you will get the full penalty (0 point).

      The course project will consist of design and development of a web application using the techniques learned in this course. <mark style="background-color=yellow">Each group functions as a team to work on the project</mark>. The purpose of this project is to help you gain in-depth experience with the development of Web Applications. You need to do your course project step-by-step as we introduce new topics along the semester. Your project status will be periodically checked and a grade may be assigned.
